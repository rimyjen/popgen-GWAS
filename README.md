# Abstract  
Eye color is a heritable, highly complex trait in humans. This study seeks to identify SNPs associated with eye color and include a general discussion of the steps in a genome wide association study, using data from OpenSNP involving 1287 individuals of unknown ancestry and sex, coming from 4 different chips. We identify 2 independently associated SNPs, both located in the HERC2 gene on chromosome 15, likely having an epistatic effect on the upstream OCA2 gene responsible for melanin production.
